# CC:Tweaked Server Wide Web Server and Client ENV

This is a "Browser" for Multiplayer/Singleplayer Server using Rednet
you can write your own custom pages in json and link systems to it (update with auto rel coming soon)
# How to use the Client side?
install and run client.lua after that it`s just like a Browser.
# How to use the Server side?
put a modem on the top side of the computer.
Then install and open the file and configure the following values to your liking:
servername; domain
After that get a disk drive and place it under the copmputer and insert a Disk.
This disk is the place where all pages are stored the main page of your server should always be called home.json
